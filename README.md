I design and build structured, scalable digital products.

Background in business & marketing (ESC Amiens), now focused on software engineering and product architecture. I work at the intersection of technical execution, system design, and product thinking.

Currently deepening low-level foundations (École 42), while building real-world SaaS and internal tools using modern web stacks.
