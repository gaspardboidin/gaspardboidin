# 👨‍💻 Welcome to My GitHub!
## 📝 About Me
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in **Web Marketing** from ESC Amiens, but I decided to shift my career toward **software development**, a field that has fascinated me since childhood.

My turning point? The numerous startup ideas I wanted to bring to life. To make them a reality, I needed **strong programming skills**. Today, I am a student at **42 Paris**, where I specialize in low-level programming, algorithms, and Unix systems.

I have a keen interest in **artificial intelligence**, and I plan to specialize in this field in the future. For now, I am focused on mastering the technical foundations.

## 🚀 Technical Skills
### 📌 Currently Learning
**C & Shell** – Low-level development, memory management, file manipulation.
Algorithms – Data structures, recursion, resource management.

**Linux (Debian), Windows (with WSL) & MacOS** – System administration, development environment.

**Git & GitHub** – Version control and best coding practices.

### 📌 Coming Soon
**C++** – Object-oriented programming and advanced optimization.

**Docker** – Containerization and environment management.

**Python** – Automation, scripting, and potential AI applications.

**PHP & TypeScript** – Web development and backend programming.

*(These technologies will be explored as I progress through École 42.)*

## 📂 Key Projects
**📜 [Libft](https://github.com/gaspardboidin/Libft) – My Custom C Library**

🔹 A reimplementation of standard libc functions in C.

🔹 Serves as a foundation for more advanced projects such as Get_Next_Line and Printf.

**🖨️ [Printf](https://github.com/gaspardboidin/Printf) – Custom Printf Implementation**

🔹 A reproduction of the printf() function in C, handling variadic arguments and optimized for performance.

**📄 [Get_Next_Line](https://github.com/gaspardboidin/Get_Next_Line) – Reading Files Line by Line**

🔹 Efficient memory management and buffer adaptation using BUFFER_SIZE.

*(More projects will be added progressively!)*

## 🎯 Goals
### 📌 Short Term
✅ Complete the common core curriculum at École 42 by December 2025.

🔹 Develop a deep understanding of C, Shell, algorithms, and system management.

🔹 Enhance my skills in code optimization, memory management, and low-level development.

🔹 Work on personal and open-source projects to strengthen my portfolio.

### 📌 Mid Term
✅ Secure an internship abroad, ideally in the United States.

🔹 Gain experience in an international work environment.

🔹 Work on real-world projects to apply my software development skills.

🔹 Build a professional network in the tech industry.

### 📌 Long Term
✅ Join a company that aligns with my values or launch my own startup.

🔹 Contribute to innovative projects, particularly in software development and artificial intelligence.

🔹 Continue learning and advancing toward cutting-edge technologies (C++, Python, Machine Learning).

🔹 If the right opportunity arises, found my own company, merging tech, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
