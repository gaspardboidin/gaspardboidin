# 👨‍💻 Welcome to My GitHub!
## 📝 About Me
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in **Web Marketing** from ESC Amiens, but I decided to shift my career toward **software development**, a field that has fascinated me since childhood.

My turning point? The numerous startup ideas I wanted to bring to life. To make them a reality, I needed **strong programming skills**. Today, I am a student at **42 Paris**, where I specialize in low-level programming, algorithms, and Unix systems.

I have a keen interest in **artificial intelligence**, and I plan to specialize in this field in the future. For now, I am focused on mastering the technical foundations.

## 🚀 Technical Skills
### 📌 Currently Learning
**C & Shell** – Low-level development, memory management, file manipulation.
Algorithms – Data structures, recursion, resource management.

**Linux (Debian), Windows (with WSL) & MacOS** – System administration, development environment.

**Git & GitHub** – Version control and best coding practices.

### 📌 Coming Soon
**C++** – Object-oriented programming and advanced optimization.

**Docker** – Containerization and environment management.

**Python** – Automation, scripting, and potential AI applications.

**PHP & TypeScript** – Web development and backend programming.

*(These technologies will be explored as I progress through École 42.)*
